     *  FSEventStreamCreate()
     *
     *  Discussion:
     *    Creates a new FS event stream object with the given parameters.
     *    In order to start receiving callbacks you must also call
     *    FSEventStreamScheduleWithRunLoop() and FSEventStreamStart().
     *
     *  Parameters:
     *
     *    allocator:
     *      The CFAllocator to be used to allocate memory for the stream.
     *      Pass NULL or kCFAllocatorDefault to use the current default
     *      allocator.
     *
     *    callback:
     *      An FSEventStreamCallback which will be called when FS events
     *      occur.
     *
     *    context:
     *      A pointer to the FSEventStreamContext structure the client
     *      wants to associate with this stream.  Its fields are copied out
     *      into the stream itself so its memory can be released after the
     *      stream is created.  Passing NULL is allowed and has the same
     *      effect as passing a structure whose fields are all set to zero.
     *
     *    pathsToWatch:
     *      A CFArray of CFStringRefs, each specifying a path to a
     *      directory, signifying the root of a filesystem hierarchy to be
     *      watched for modifications.
     *
     *    sinceWhen:
     *      The service will supply events that have happened after the
     *      given event ID. To ask for events "since now" pass the constant
     *      kFSEventStreamEventIdSinceNow. Often, clients will supply the
     *      highest-numbered FSEventStreamEventId they have received in a
     *      callback, which they can obtain via the
     *      FSEventStreamGetLatestEventId() accessor. Do not pass zero for
     *      sinceWhen, unless you want to receive events for every
     *      directory modified since "the beginning of time" -- an unlikely
     *      scenario.
     *
     *    latency:
     *      The number of seconds the service should wait after hearing
     *      about an event from the kernel before passing it along to the
     *      client via its callback. Specifying a larger value may result
     *      in more effective temporal coalescing, resulting in fewer
     *      callbacks and greater overall efficiency.
     *
     *    flags:
     *      Flags that modify the behavior of the stream being created. See
     *      FSEventStreamCreateFlags.
     *
     *  Result:
     *    A valid FSEventStreamRef.
