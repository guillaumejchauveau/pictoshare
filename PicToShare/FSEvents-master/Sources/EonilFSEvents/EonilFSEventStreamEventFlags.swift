/*
 *  FSEventStreamEventFlags
 *
 *  Discussion:
 *    Flags that can be passed to your FSEventStreamCallback function.
 *
 *    It is important to note that event flags are simply hints about the
 *    sort of operations that occurred at that path.
 *
 *    Furthermore, the FSEvent stream should NOT be treated as a form of
 *    historical log that could somehow be replayed to arrive at the
 *    current state of the file system.
 *
 *    The FSEvent stream simply indicates what paths changed; and clients
 *    need to reconcile what is really in the file system with their internal
 *    data model - and recognize that what is actually in the file system can
 *    change immediately after you check it.
